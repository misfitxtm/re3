Building on Linux

This wiki page shows how to build re3 on various Linux distros. Tested on x86, x86_64, arm64 architectures, and GCC 7.5.0, 8.3.0, clang 10.0 compilers. In case of issues, fill an issue on github to be reviewed by one of the re3 developers.

You need libraries and headers of;

    openal / libopenal-dev
    GLEW / libglew-dev (i386 unavailable on apt after Ubuntu 19.10)
    glfw / libglfw3-dev (min. 3.3 is required, i386 unavailable on apt after Ubuntu 19.10)
    libsndfile1-dev (Caution: install this before libmpg123-dev, optional)
    libmpg123-dev

and compilers set up, i.e. for Ubuntu you should install build-essential.
Steps

    Run $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/GTAmodding/re3.git to clone the project to your PC

    Enter the newly created re3 directory;
        If you're on x86/x86_64, run $ ./premake5Linux --with-librw gmake2.
        If you're on i.e. arm/arm64, you need to build your own premake5 from source. Then you can proceed to running premake5 with --with-librw gmake2 arguments.

    Enter the build directory and run $ make help to see a help message with supported build configurations and architectures. As of now, refer to one of the available configurations:
        debug_linux-x86-librw_gl3_glfw-oal
        debug_linux-amd64-librw_gl3_glfw-oal
        debug_linux-arm-librw_gl3_glfw-oal
        debug_linux-arm64-librw_gl3_glfw-oal
        release_linux-x86-librw_gl3_glfw-oal
        release_linux-amd64-librw_gl3_glfw-oal
        release_linux-arm-librw_gl3_glfw-oal
        release_linux-arm64-librw_gl3_glfw-oal

    Compile librw and re3 by running $ make config=(your configuration goes here). If you want you can change compiler with setting CC and CXX.

    In case you didn't copy some of the required gamefiles, copy all content from re3/gamefiles/ to the game root directory

    (If you didn't set GTA_III_RE_DIR env. variable) Revisit the re3 directory, go to bin and find the appropriate re3 binary you just compiled, and copy it to your game folder with GTA3 inside

    Play the game by running $ ./re3

You can expect poor performance if you're not using Nvidia/AMD drivers. (At least it was in my case with my iGPU)

Remember that re3 is an actively developed project which doesn't have a final version, so in case you'd like to get the game updated you have to reproduce the steps above.

Struct sizes are different then on Windows, so don't enable validating struct sizes. Needlesly to say, your previous savegames will be incompatible.
